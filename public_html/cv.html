                                Coursework is to design, buld and test an application that will at will enable the inputting of messages in any of the 3 diffrent forms. The system must detect the message type and output each message in JSON format in a file. You are required to research JSON and identify an appropriate API to allow serialisation in a JSON file.
                            </p>

                        <ul><h2>Year 2 Modules</h2>
                            <li><b>Software Development 2</b></li>
                            <p>
                            In this module we learn about object-oriented programming using C#, Testing models, Design Patterns, Relations and Polymorphism.<br>
                            Coursework 1 was to design and build a Conference System. That would also display a certificate of attendance and an invoice. <br>
                            Coursework 2 was to design, build and test a reservation system. the system would have to preseve data from previous sessions. I also implemented valdation that did not allow users to books dates in the past and to check out before they arrived.
                            </p>

                            <li><b>Systems and Services</b></li>
                           <p> This module was split between hardwre and Linux operating systems, we were graded by one practical and one exam. the practical was to design and write a linux script to act as a "windows" recycling bin so that when a user "deleted" it went to that folder instead i had to write a scripte to to delete and restore a sigle file or all file from the recyling bin.
                            </p>
                            <li><b>Database Systems</b></li>
                            <p>This module was mainly about SQL however we also covered a little of NoSQL. We also learned about normalisatin adn about database design.
                            </p>
                            <li><b>Web Technologies</b></li>
                            <p>This module was mainly all about front end web development. we learned about HTML, CSS, jQuery, PHP, Javascript.<br> Coursework 1 was to build a web based application that allows users to book their chosen seats in the Dominion Cinema.<br>
                            <iframe src="http://40270320.set08101.napier.ac.uk/cw1/index.html"height="500" width="100%"></iframe>
                            
                            <br>
                            <p>Coursework 2 was to build an online system to allow students to provide module feedback using web pages. we also had to design an output page to allow staff to view the feedback.feedback was stored into a database after the user submited. It allowed staff to enter a single module number for the output scores screen. It allowed you to enter two module numbers for the output comparison screen. Output was read from a database after the user submited. Both pages had to scale wll for mobile devices. <br>
                            <h3>Feedback Screen<br>(Matriculation Number: 50202496)</h3>

                            <p>approaches and lifecycles, requirements analysis, specification, modelling, and prototype implementation.<br>
                            Modelling of Software Systems was done using the Unified Modelling Language (UML)<br>
                            Coursework was to design, build a prototype and implement unit tests for a meal-sharing app. the design was to include a Case Diagram, Activity Diagram and a Sequence Diagram. we aslo hadto create a State Diagram.
    
                            </p>

                            <li><b>Mobile App Development</b></li>
                            <p>This module covered the application development life-cycle for mobile apps.we also looked at the application development methodology used for mobile apps, taking into consideration the limitations of the mobile device platform and the opportunities provided through GPS, cloud services and orientation sensors.<br>
                            Coursework was to design, build and demostrate an app that we built. we had free choice of what the app was to do.<br><h4>My App Details<br></h4>
                            As an amateur photographer, I would like to be able to save certain locations to revisit. I have found a few apps that do this job, such as Google Maps, however these apps also do other things like tell you what is nearby which I believe make theses apps more bloated and complicated than the need to be. <br>
                            Basic Idea: <br>
                            The app I proposed to build would allow the user save their favourite photography spots when out on location. The app will only use GPS for finding the user’s location, which is an advantage in cases where location data communication cannot be accessed. For example in the Trossachs National Park there is very little 2g or 3g mobile coverage.<br>
                            Google Maps API is integrated into the app which allows the user to easily get directions back to the exact location.<br>
                            I am contining to develope this app and hopefully will release it to the Play Store.
